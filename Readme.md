# SIP (Structural Integrity Protocol)

SIP is a minimal framework for evaluating whether an output is decision-grade rather than narrative-grade.

It originated from AI cost-efficiency experiments where fluency proved to be a misleading proxy for value.

## Why SIP Exists

Modern AI systems optimize for:
- Fluency
- Coherence
- Politeness
- Persuasion

These traits often produce outputs that sound competent but do not support real decisions.

SIP reframes usefulness as:
How much structural clarity does this artifact produce?

## Core Dimensions

- P — Problem constraint clarity  
- Q — Interrogation / falsifiability  
- C — Synthesis / entropy reduction  

Artifacts with low PQC should not be trusted for decision-making, regardless of polish.

## What SIP Is For
- Internal strategy memos
- Risk assessments
- AI-assisted workflows
- Investment analysis
- Governance documents
- Operational decision support

## What SIP Is Not For
- Marketing content
- Public essays
- Creative writing
- Persuasion scoring

Public artifacts often score low due to institutional constraints, not weak thinking.

## Relationship to AI Cost Efficiency

AI cost efficiency is meaningless without defining useful output.

SIP defines usefulness structurally:
Does the artifact define constraints, challenge assumptions, and reduce uncertainty?

Efficiency can then be measured as:
Decision-grade structure produced per unit of cost.

## Status
SIP v1:
- Simple
- Falsifiable
- Operator-oriented
- Designed to evolve with testing data
